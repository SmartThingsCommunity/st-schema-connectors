Getting started with SmartThings:

1. Remix the project.
2. Update discoveryResponse.json and refreshResponse.json with the smart device details. (optional)
3. Once the remixed app is up and running, you have a webhook url ready.
4. Register the webhook url in developer workspace and deploy it. (https://devworkspace.developer.samsung.com/workspace )
5. On the SmartThings app you can add the device and control your smart device.
